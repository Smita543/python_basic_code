#4 types of operator - i arithmetic, ii assignment , iii  comparison, iv logical

# i- arithmetic operator =>  +, -, /, % ..etc
'''
a = 10
b = 5
print("value of a+b is ",a + b)
print("value of a-b is ",a - b)
print("value of a/b is ",a /b)
print("value of a%b is ",a % b)
'''
# ii- assignment operator => = ,+= ,-= ...etc
'''c= 2
c+=2
print("value of c is ",c)
c-=3
print("value of c is ",c)
'''

# iii- comparison operator => == , > , <, <=, >= , !=   ..etc  which returns true and false .
'''d = 5
e = 10
print(d > e)
print(d < e)
print(d >= e)
print(d <= e) '''

# iv - logical operator => and ,or ,not

print("value of bool1 and bool2 is ", bool1 and bool2) 
print("value of bool1 or bool2 is ", bool1 or bool2) 
print("value of bool2 is ", not bool2)
